bambam's build process for Linux (tested in Ubuntu Xerces)
==========================================================

# Move to where you want to put it (I always put source code in $HOME/src).
$ cd ~/src

# Clone the repo.
$ git clone git://github.com/mweiss001/purple_martians.git

# Move to the source tree.
$ cd purple_martians

# Add bambams' repo.
$ git remote add bambams git://github.com/bambams/purple_martians.git

# Fetch bambams' changes.
$ git fetch bambams

# Start a throw away branch off of origin/master.
$ git checkout -b tmp

# Merge bambams/bambuild branch into your throwaway branch based on origin/master.
$ git merge bambams/bambuild

# Build the embedded libnet and install into $HOME/include and $HOME/lib.
$ (cd libnet; make PREFIX=$HOME lib install)

# Build the game using bambams' Makefile (expects libnet in $HOME).
$ make

I don't think you'll need $HOME/lib added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH because we're
linking with a static library, but if you do you can just define it on the
command line:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/lib" ./pm
