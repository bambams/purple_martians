The executable is called 'pm'

But you can't run it directly until the libraries are set up.

Option 1:
Use the script 'pml' to run the game:
The contents of pml are:  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./linux_libs ./pm"

Option 2:
Copy the contents of /linux_libs to /usr/lib
Then you can run 'pm' without needing the script


Currently only 2 libraries are needed:
liballegro_monolith.so.5.2
libdumb.so.1
